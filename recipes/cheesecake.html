  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p><strong>Cheesecake</strong> is a sweet dessert consisting of one or more layers. The main, and thickest, layer consists of a mixture of a soft, fresh cheese, eggs, and sugar. If there is a bottom layer, it most often consists of a crust or base made from crushed cookies, graham crackers, pastry, or sometimes sponge cake. Cheesecake may be baked or unbaked and is usually refrigerated.</p> 
  <p><strong>New York-style cheesecake</strong> uses a cream cheese base, also incorporating heavy cream or sour cream. The typical New York cheesecake is rich and has a dense, smooth, and creamy consistency</p>


  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  
  <ul>
    <li>15 graham crackers, crushed</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
    <li>4 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese</li>
    <li>1 ½ cups white sugar</li>
    <li>¾ cup milk</li>
    <li>4 eggs</li>
    <li>1 cup sour cream</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon vanilla extract</li>
    <li>¼ cup all-purpose flour</li>
  </ul>



  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9 inch springform pan.</li>
    <li>In a medium bowl, mix graham cracker crumbs with melted butter. Press onto bottom of springform pan.</li>
    <li>In a large bowl, mix cream cheese with sugar until smooth. Blend in milk, and then mix in the eggs one at a time, mixing just enough to incorporate. Mix in sour cream, vanilla and flour until smooth. Pour filling into prepared crust. </li>
    <li>Bake in preheated oven for 1 hour. Turn the oven off, and let cake cool in oven with the door closed for 5 to 6 hours; this prevents cracking. Chill in refrigerator until serving.</li>
