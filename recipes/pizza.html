  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p><strong>Pizza Margherita</strong> is a typical Neapolitan pizza, made with San Marzano tomatoes, buffalo mozzarella cheese, fresh basil, salt, and extra-virgin olive oil.  </p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <h3>For the dough (10 servings)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>1 L (4 1/4 cups) water</li>
    <li>40 - 60g (1.4 - 2.1 oz) salt</li>
    <li>3g (1/2 tsp) fresh yeast</li>
    <li>1,6 - 1,8 kg (13 1/3 - 15 cups) flour, 00 type</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>For the topping</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>60 - 80g (2.1 - 2.8 oz) canned, peeled tomatoes</li>
    <li>6 - 7g (1 1/2 tsp) virgin or extra virgin olive oil</li>
    <li>80 - 100g (2.8 - 3.5 oz) buffalo mozzarella/fior di latte</li>
    <li>a few fresh basil leaves</li>
    <li>5 - 7g (1 1/2 tsp) hard cheese (grated), optional</li>
  </ul>



  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Dissolve salt in water, then add the yeast to the water and dissolve. Immediately add a portion of the flour to the water and mix. Add the remaining flour in batches, gauging how much flour is enough. </li>
    <li>Knead for a minimum of 15-20 minutes, but ideally, 30 minutes — the dough is of ideal consistency when it's a bit sticky on the hands, and on the sides of a bowl, you're mixing it in. </li>
    <li>Shape it into a ball, then lightly coat with flour, to prevent losing moisture as it rises.</li>
    <li>Place the dough in a large bowl, then cover it with a cloth and store it in a warm place for two hours.</li>
    <li>After two hours have passed, shape the dough into balls weighing either 200 or 280 grams (7-10 oz), depending on the size of the pizza you're making — a 22-24 cm (8.6-9.4-inch) or a 28-35 cm (11-13.5-inch) one.</li>
    <li>Once you've shaped the balls, place them all on a plate and cover them with a damp cloth and let them prove for a minimum of six hours.</li>
    <li>Once at least six hours have passed, take a ball of dough, place it on a lightly floured surface.</li>
    <li>Pressing on the ball of dough with the thumbs of your fingers, starting from the center and going towards the edges, shape into a disc, turning the dough several times in the process.</li>
    <li>As a result of this action, you should end up with a disc that has about a 1-2 cm (1/2-inch) raised rim with a center that should be approximately 0.3 cm (1/8-inch) thick.</li>
    <li>Arrange the topping (the listed amounts are for a single pizza) as follows; First, place the crushed, peeled tomatoes in the center of the pizza, then spread them with a spoon all over, except the rim, in a spiraling fashion.</li>
    <li>Next, scatter the mozzarella or fior di latte evenly over the surface, followed by a sprinkling of hard grated cheese, if you're using it.</li>
    <li>Place a few basil leaves on top, and to finish, drizzle with extra virgin olive oil, which should be applied in a circular motion, starting from the center outwards.</li>
    <li>Place the pizza on a pizza peel and then slide it into a wood-fired oven with a quick wrist motion, so the topping stays in place.</li>
    <li>Bake for 60-90 seconds in a wood-fired oven at a temperature of about 485°C/905°F, checking the doneness by carefully lifting the edges of the pizza.</li>
    <li>Also, the pizza should be rotated as it bakes but kept in the same cooking area, so every part gets baked evenly.</li>
    <li>The finished pizza should have a thick tomato sauce, with melted mozzarella and basil leaves that have browned but are not burnt.</li>
